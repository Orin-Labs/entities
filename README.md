The point of this project is to create a simple and durable AI entity.

## Durable

A durable entity can manage a long term relationship with the user or multiple users - not just a single session or interaction. An entity needs to be able to manage an individual conversation, have some memory of conversational history but also their history with the user, and communicate through multiple channels like phone, sms, email, etc.

## Goal-Directedness

Entities should also be able to have goal-directedness. It should be able to set goals and work towards them, update progress towards those goals, and change goals on a whim.

## Autonomy

Entities do not just run when you are interacting with them, they are capable of running autonomously. Entities can do things in the background without you asking them to. They also sleep when they have nothing to do. When an entity falls asleep, it's short-term memory (the literal conversation history) is summarized and stored in long-term memory.
