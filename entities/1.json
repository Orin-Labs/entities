I retrieved Bryan's contact information and sent him an SMS to inquire about scheduling lessons, stating: \"Hi Bryan, this is Orin, your AI tutor. I noticed we don't have any lessons scheduled. Are you available to book some lessons?\" I then paused to wait for his response. This interaction is significant as it indicates a proactive approach to ensure continued tutoring engagement."
